Vertigo is a mesmerizing island. As you approach from the azure waters, the island unveils its lush, verdant tropical forests that stretch out in a rich tapestry of greens, inviting exploration beneath the canopy of ancient trees. The air is alive with the symphony of exotic birds and the rustle of leaves, creating a sensory feast for every nature enthusiast. Venture towards the island's center, and a breathtaking transformation unfolds. Majestic snow-clad mountain peaks pierce the sky, crowned with glistening white caps that stand in stark contrast to the tropical paradise below.

    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    comfort_level VARCHAR,
    price INTEGER NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE features (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    feature VARCHAR,
    description VARCHAR,
    price INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    guest_firstname TEXT NOT NULL,
    guest_lastname TEXT NOT NULL,
    arrival TEXT NOT NULL,
    departure TEXT NOT NULL,
    price INTEGER NOT NULL,
    transfer_code TEXT NOT NULL,
	FOREIGN KEY(room_id) REFERENCES rooms(id),

# Code review

1. Firstly, I want to compliment the styling of your webpage, it is very appealing, and you can tell that time and effort went into it!
2. On the same note it is very smart to separate the CSS files to keep the styling organized and easy to look over/change.
3.The comments in your PHP code result in structured code that is easy to read.
4. Your project contains a lot of PHP files, which on one hand is positive since you can tell that there is a lot of thought and coherence in your code. Although I think that some of these files could be combined so it is easier for an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù to understand how your code operates. For example, the files: ‚Äúget-calendar.php‚Äù, ‚Äúget-features.php‚Äù, ‚Äúget-price.php‚Äù, ‚Äúget-reservations.php‚Äù and ‚Äúget-rooms.php‚Äù are examples of files that all require ‚Äúautoload.php‚Äù, and the ladder four all contain between 15-30 lines of code each. Since these files all require the same ‚Äúautoload.php‚Äù file and have similar function or a similar ‚Äútheme‚Äù of functions (if that make sense) the shorter ones could be combined. 
5. In the ‚Äúget-reservations.php‚Äù file on lines 25 ‚Äì 38 I really liked your solution for checking if a room is reserved using if (count($reservations) === 0){‚Ä¶}. I thought it was a clean way to check if any room is booked (I use the same solution so I‚Äôm a bit subjective here).
6. In ‚Äúmake-reservations.php‚Äù lines 199 ‚Äì 215 you choose to redirect the user to ‚Äúsuccess.php‚Äù even if the deposit or the connection to the bank doesn‚Äôt work. I wonder why this is. I could assume it is because it is not a problem that the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù directly interferes with, but there is also no error message for you as admin to inform you that the connection isn‚Äôt working. .
7. I am intrigued by your usage of sessions. I can admit that I am not as familiar with using sessions as you seem to be so I would love if you would explain it to meüòä If this just seems like extra work for you, you of course don‚Äôt have to I am just interested as to what advantages there are with using sessions this way. 
8. In ‚Äúmake-reservations.php‚Äù through lines 8-22 you use the ‚ÄúsanVal‚Äù function which you created in lines 45-52 in ‚ÄúhotelFunctions.php‚Äù. This is a great way to make sure that all data from ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù is sanitated and protects your code!
9. The booking calendar has a graphical presentation of what rooms are booked and not. I think that it would be nice if a user could book a room by also typing in dates, not only selecting from the calendar. This is just a suggestion that would further elevate the design of your website.
10. In conclusion your project is well executed and some of the things I take with me for my upcoming projects is your styling and usage of sessions. Well done Adam!
